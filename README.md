# Summer-2018-Climate-Policy-Research

I worked with Dr. Benjamin Sosnaud in the summer of 2018 to analyze whether climate opinion influenced the level of climate policy being enacted on a local level in the United States. Most of my work over the summer involved scraping data on climate opinion, climate policy, and related control variables from the internet and formatting the data into google sheets spreadsheets. All of this code was written in Python, most of it using the BeautifulSoup, xlsxwriter, xlrd, and pandas packages.
